## Available Skills

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| `company-research` | Researches a prospect company and produces a full BD intelligence report — turnover, directors, reviews, KServe fit assessment, and actionable outreach briefing |

## How to use

Once installed, just ask naturally in any supported AI platform:

- `"Research Reliance Retail for BD"`
- `"Look up Bajaj Finance — potential outsourcing client"`
- `"Do a BD profile for Zepto, their website is zepto.co"`
- `"Get me info on this company: www.meesho.com"`
- `"Check out HDFC Ergo for a KServe pitch"`

The skill confirms the right company with you first, then runs the full research automatically.
